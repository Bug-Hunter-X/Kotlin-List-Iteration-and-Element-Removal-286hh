This example showcases a common error when removing elements from a mutable list in Kotlin while iterating.  The `removeIf` method is concise and efficient for removing elements based on a predicate. However, directly modifying the list during a standard for loop or enhanced for loop can lead to unexpected behavior due to the index changes. Using an iterator (as shown) to traverse and remove elements is necessary to avoid such problems.
